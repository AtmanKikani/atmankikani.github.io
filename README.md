# Atman Kikani – Robotics Portfolio

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio website: **[atmankikani.github.io](https://atmankikani.github.io/)**.

I work at the intersection of **underwater robotics**, **SLAM**, **sensor fusion**, **control**, and **embedded systems**. The site highlights:

- **Dreadnought Robotics AUV work** – autonomy stack for MIRA 2.0, including cascaded 6‑DOF control, MPC, fuzzy mission planning, and real‑time ROS2–MAVLINK pipelines, used in **TAC Challenge Norway 2024 (2nd place)** and the **IEEE OES Singapore AUV Challenge**.  
- **HADVel project** – hydrodynamics‑aware deep learning for AUV velocity estimation, covering both the core physics‑informed LSTM architecture and its embedded deployment on custom hardware (HADVel‑E).  
- **MARVO** – Marine‑Adaptive Radiance‑aware Visual Odometry, an underwater visual‑inertial SLAM system using transformers, radiance correction, GTSAM fusion, and RL‑based pose‑graph optimization.  
- **Engineering systems** – ESP32 Cubli reaction‑wheel pendulum, thrust‑vectored monocopter, IMU‑based sparse surface mapper, FRAME multi‑camera ArUco tracking, DPSS differential pressure speed sensor, and a smart elevator IoT system (patent application).

The portfolio is meant to provide an honest view of the robots, algorithms, and hardware I’ve actually built and deployed, and to serve as a hub for my projects, media, and research artifacts.
